# web_scraper_test
Small web scraper to collect news headlines from different sources. 
Now uses Chromedriver.exe to navigate with Selenium. So, this is a required software.

Usage: In working_example.py. Now its working with Boeing Company headlines in the NYTimes (educational purposes)
Got to the main() function and change the URL if you want, and look for the required XPATH and html class_ you are looking for

    TODO: 1) Configure __setup__.py with the required packages for this module (numpy, pandas, 
    bs4, Selenium and ChromeDriver.exe)
    2) Handle erros with I/O exceptions for .csv reading and writing
    3) Implement URL input, and improve the XPATH and HTML's body search
    4) Rethink the class hierarchy.
